# Login Page Project

This project is a responsive login page implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Responsive design for both mobile and desktop screens
- Integration with dummy authentication service
- Simple and clean user interface

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Running the Project

This is a static website, so you don't need any special server to run it. Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

If you want to use a local server, you can use tools like:

- Python's built-in HTTP server: - Node.js `http-server`:


npx http-server


Then open `http://localhost:8000` (or whatever port your server is using) in your web browser.

## Integration with Dummy Service

This project uses `https://dummyjson.com/auth/login` for simulating authentication. The integration is done in the `script.js` file.

## Customization

You can easily customize the colors, fonts, and layout by modifying the `styles.css` file.

## Dependencies

- Google Fonts (Roboto)

No other external libraries or frameworks are used.
